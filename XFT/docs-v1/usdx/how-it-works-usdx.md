# How it Works

There are three major processes for USDX:

- **Subscriptions**: Creating new USDX tokens.
- **Redemptions**: Returning Tokens to XFT to get money back (plus accrued yield).
- **Transfers**: Selling Tokens in the secondary market or using them within DeFi.

## I. Subscriptions

---

**Step 1: Deposits**  
Once you complete onboarding, you can choose to deposit funds in three ways: (a) in USD via wire transfer, (b) in USDC via our web interface, or (c) in USDT via direct stablecoin transfer. Your subscription is considered ‘made’ at the time we receive the wire or, for USDC/USDT, when we convert it to USD and initiate the wire to our primary bank account. (Typically happens within one Business Day).

**Step 2: Cohort Assignment**  
Each subscription is assigned a cohort for legal and regulatory reasons. Your investment's Closing Date determines which cohort your loan is part of. Each cohort runs from Wednesday to Tuesday. The cohort determines when you can claim your Tokens.

> *Note: Subscriptions and redemptions after 8pm UTC Tuesday are treated ‘as if’ they happened on Wednesday.*

**Step 3: Certificate and USDXc Generation**  
**Temporary Global Certificate Generation**  
Within three Business Days of your subscription, you receive a Temporary Global Certificate representing your rights to payment. USDX tokens are not provided immediately due to transfer restrictions. Instead, the Certificate represents the USDX tokens you are eligible to receive after the Restricted Period.

**USDXc Generation**  
When your Temporary Global Certificate is issued, USDXc tokens (Cooking USDX) are minted. These tokens serve as an onchain bookkeeping representation of the Certificate and are burned when the USDX tokens are minted.

**Step 4: Token Minting & Claiming**  
The Restricted Period on your Certificate starts the day after your cohort ends. Forty days later, your Token Eligibility Date is when your Tokens can be minted and claimed. Notifications will be sent upon key events like application approval, fund eligibility, Certificate generation, and token readiness.

## II. Redemptions

**Step 1: Redemption Request**  
To request redemption, use our web interface or email alex@alexandros-securities.com if you have a Temporary Global Certificate. Note: If your Certificate is less than two Business Days away from the Token Eligibility Date, you must wait until Tokens are minted to request redemption.

**Step 2: Redemption Fulfillment**  
Redemptions typically take two Business Days to fulfill. Fees depend on the redemption amount:
- Less than $100,000: Fees associated with the transfer are deducted.
- $100,000 or more: Wire fees are covered by XFT. Currency fees or exchange risks are borne by the redeemer.

All redemptions are in US Dollars and must be made via wire transfer to bank accounts outside the US.

## III. Secondary Markets or Transfers

---

Once minted, Tokens are transferable to anyone within eligible geographies, including selling, utilizing within DeFi, or buying more Tokens from others.
