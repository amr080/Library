# Redeeming USDX

There is no minimum redemption amount, and you can redeem the full amount of their portfolio at any time.

To redeem USDX:

1. To redeem USDX, transfer the token to 0x43415eB6ff9DB7E26A15b704e7A3eDCe97d31C4e, or call the burn() function on the USDX token contract. Either method will initiate a redemption.
2. To redeem shares held in book-entry by Superstate, contact your account manager.
3. If your redemption request is received before 9:00 am ET on a market day, you will receive payment using the prior market day’s closing NAV/S.
4. If your redemption request is received after 9:00 am ET on a market day, you will receive payment using that day’s closing NAV/S.
5. Payment will be completed in U.S. Dollars to the bank account on file, or USDC to your redemption address on file, based on your organization’s settings.

Redemptions are viewable in the Investor Portal, and you will receive confirmation emails when a redemption has been initiated and completed.

Gas fees to burn or transfer USDX are the responsibility of the investor.
