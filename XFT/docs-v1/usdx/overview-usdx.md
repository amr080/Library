## What is USDX?

USDX is a tokenized note secured by short-term US Treasuries and bank demand deposits. USDX is accessible to non-US individual and institutional investors and is designed to combine the accessibility of a stablecoin with high-quality, US dollar-denominated yield.

Creating a product that meets these requirements while also complying with applicable US laws and regulations does impose some limitations, however. For example, although you start earning interest as soon as we process your deposit, note that we can only mint your transferable USDX tokens between 40-50 days later (depending upon exactly when you invest). Furthermore, we can only redeem to USD via bank wire to non-US bank accounts.

USDX comes in two versions: an “accumulating” version (USDX) whose per-token price increases as yield accrues, and a “rebasing” version (rUSDX) whose price remains at US$1.00. Whereas the price of USDX tokens increases as the value of the underlying assets increase, with rUSDX you simply receive more rUSDX in your wallet; in effect the yield on the underlying assets accrues in the form of additional rUSDX tokens. For example, if you acquired 100 rUSDX tokens when the price per token of USDX was $1.00 – and then the price per token of USDX increased to US$1.01, the price per token of rUSDX would remain at $1.00, but your wallet would now hold 101 rUSDX tokens. This ‘rebasing’ happens automatically when the USDX price is updated each business day.

You can easily and instantly convert back and forth between USDX and rUSDX on our website at any time.

## How does it work?

---

### I. Onboarding

To onboard you must be eligible and complete our [Know Your Customer (KYC)](link_to_kyc) process, provide us with the wallet address where you would like to receive your Tokens, and sign the [appropriate paperwork](link_to_paperwork).

### II. Investing

1. **Deposit Funds.** Once your onboarding is completed, you will receive an email stating when you are eligible to invest. From then on, you can deposit USDC at any time and USDT. (For deposits of $100K plus, USD bank wires are also possible. Contact us for more information). You will start [earning interest](link_to_interest_info) as soon as we process your funds (typically within 2-3 Business Days).

2. **Cohort Assignment.** Your purchase will be assigned a [cohort](link_to_cohort_info), which determines the date on which we can provide you with your tokens. This approach ensures compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

3. **Certificate Generation.** As soon as we process your funds, you will receive a [Temporary Global Certificate](link_to_certificate_info) that entitles you to receive your actual tokens as soon as we're allowed to provide them to you. This is between 40 and 50 days after we process your deposit. This date is listed on your Temporary Global Certificate.

4. **Token Minting.** As soon as the required amount of time has passed, you will receive your tokens in your designated wallet. You are then free to transfer your tokens to anyone within eligible geographies.

### Redeeming

Note that to comply with applicable US laws and regulations, we can only redeem USD via bank wire to non-US bank accounts. If you wish to redeem, you will be required to provide us with such bank details before we can process a redemption request. Note that redemption for Temporary Global Certificates (i.e. prior to your token issuance) is only available for amounts greater than $100,000; for amounts less than this, you will need to wait until your Tokens are minted.

## Understanding rUSDX

---

**rUSDX = A Type of ‘Wrapped’ USDX**

It’s important to understand that each rUSDX still corresponds to some amount of “regular” USDX that is locked in a wrapper contract. This wrapper contract locks the USDX in the contract, mints the corresponding amount of rUSDX, and sends that rUSDX to your wallet. For example, if you had 1,000 USDX tokens worth $10 each — so, a total of $10,000 of value — the 1,000 USDX would be locked in the wrapper contract, which would then mint 10,000 rUSDX tokens and then send those to your wallet. Conversely, if you wanted to [convert](link_to_conversion) your rUSDX tokens back to USDX tokens, your rUSDX tokens would be sent to the wrapper contract. This wrapper would then burn the rUSDX tokens, “unlock” the corresponding number of USDX tokens, and send those USDX tokens to your wallet.

This means that the *total* supply of USDX is comprised of two ‘types’ of USDX:

- **Wrapped USDX** - i.e. USDX that is locked in the rUSDX wrapper contract and corresponds to the ‘reserve’ for the corresponding issued rUSDX.
- **Non-Wrapped USDX** — i.e. USDX that isn’t locked in the rUSDX wrapper contract.

There are three important implications of this:

- The “dollar value” that is represented by all rUSDX tokens is exactly equal to the amount of “dollar value” represented by all applicable wrapped USDX tokens. In other words, **TVL_rUSDX = TVL_Wrapped_USDX** → `TVL_rUSDX = Num_Wrapped_USDX_Tokens * TokenReferencePrice_per_USDX` (Token Reference Price is the ‘face value’ of the token. You can learn more about how the price of USDX is determined [here](link_to_price_determination)).
- Because of this, if you were to add up the total amount of USDX and the amount of rUSDX, you would be **double counting the value of the wrapped USDX**, because some of that value is already represented by the rUSDX.
- Therefore, to properly calculate the TVL of USDX, the appropriate calculation is as follows:

`Total USDX TVL (e.g. both versions) = Num_rUSDX_Tokens * $1.00 + Num_Non-Wrapped_USDX_Tokens * TokenReferencePrice_per_USDX`

**OR**

`Total USDX TVL (e.g. both versions) = (Num_Wrapped_USDX_Tokens + Num_Non-Wrapped_USDX_Tokens) * TokenReferencePrice_per_USDX`

i.e. the two calculations should result in the same number (adjusting for rounding).

## rUSDX Price Stability via Rebasing

Rebasing is a mechanism through which the total supply of tokens is adjusted. The basic intuition is that, if we’re trying to keep the price per token at $1.00, as the value of rUSDX’s underlying assets increase in value, we need to increase the number of tokens such that the “value of assets” divided by the number of tokens remains constant. For tokens like USDX and rUSDX, the redemption value of the rUSDX token can be calculated by dividing the TVL of the rUSDX share class by the number of rUSDX tokens:

`TokenReferencePrice_per_rUSDX = TVL_rUSDX / Num_rUSDX_Tokens`

From above, recall that:

`TVL_rUSDX = Num_Wrapped_USDX_Tokens * TokenReferencePrice_per_USDX`

so we have:

`TokenReferencePrice_per_rUSDX = (Num_Wrapped_USDX_Tokens * TokenReferencePrice_per_USDX) / Num_rUSDX_Tokens`

Therefore, as `TokenReferencePrice_per_USDX` increases each day based on the Token yield rate for that month, `TokenReferencePrice_per_rUSDX` would also increase…unless we also increased `Num_rUSDX_Tokens`. Since we want to keep `TokenReferencePrice_per_rUSDX` at $1.00, this means that we must increase `Num_rUSDX_Tokens` to keep the price at $1.00.
