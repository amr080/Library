# Getting Started

Welcome to X Protocol! We believe in a world where access to the "risk-free rate" is available for everyone in an enterprise-grade and regulated product that is safe for developers to evolve the world finance stack.

X Protocol believes that yield-bearing stablecoins should provide the following:

- Permissionless composability
- Regulatory compliance
- Enterprise-grade setup
- Seamless User Experience

X Financial Technologies has a suite of products: USDX and the X Protocol Platform.

## USDX token

The USDX token is a rebasing ERC20 token, redeemable at a pegged 1:1 USD value by primary users. USDX is a fully backed stablecoin, backed by "USDX Reserves", which are held under custody with regulated financial institutions in bankruptcy-remote accounts, segregated from the Company's operating accounts, on behalf of, and for the benefit of, Users.

## X Protocol

The X Protocol Platform allows Primary users (or Primary Customers, used interchangeably) to purchase or redeem USDX 1:1.

Initially, purchases and redemptions will be enabled for USDC, with fiat payments coming next. Other stablecoins will be considered in the future, pending reliable and affordable off-ramping partners and sufficient market demand.
