# Purchasing USDX

After completing onboarding, you’ll receive USDX purchase instructions for U.S. Dollar wires and USDC transfers in the Investor Portal.

The minimum initial investment is $100,000, unless waived by Superstate (e.g. to test the flow of funds).

To purchase USDX:

1. Initiate a bank wire, or transfer USDC to your USDX Purchase Address
2. If your funds are received before 9:00 am ET on a market day, you will receive USDX at the prior market day’s closing NAV/S, shortly after 9:00 am ET.
3. If your funds are received after 9:00 am ET, you will receive USDX at the next available NAV/S, shortly after 9:00 am ET on the next market day.
4. USDX is delivered to your preferred Ethereum Allowlist address, or held in book-entry at Superstate based on your organization’s settings.

Purchases are viewable in the Investor Portal, and you will receive confirmation emails when a purchase has been initiated and completed. 

Gas fees to transfer USDC or bank fees to wire U.S. Dollars for purchases are the responsibility of the investor.
