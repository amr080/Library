# Welcome to XFT's resource hub

At XFT, our mission is to make institutional-grade financial products and services available to everyone. We believe that blockchain technology has the potential to improve both the infrastructure of — and access to — financial products and services. We also believe that the best technical improvements need to be combined with the best practices from traditional finance, including investor protections, transparency in reporting, legal and regulatory compliance, intelligent and robust product structuring, working with the best service providers, and top-notch client service.

To help us do this, we have an asset management arm that creates and manages tokenized financial products as well as a technology arm that develops decentralized finance protocols.
