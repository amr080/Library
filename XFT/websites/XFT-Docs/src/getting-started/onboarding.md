# Onboarding

---

## Creating an account
Contact our Investor Relations team at alex@alexandros-securities.com to get started. We'll guide you through the onboarding process and provide a link to create your account. You can register as an Individual or an Institution. Once your account is set up, you'll gain access to our Investor Portal, where you can invite team members and complete the onboarding steps.


## Applications
After logging into the Investor Portal, you'll need to complete two types of applications:

1. Investing Entity Application: This verifies your eligibility to invest in XFT Funds. It collects essential information about you or your Investing Entity. For a list of documents that we require during this application, please see Onboarding: Required Documents

2. Fund Applications: For each XFT Fund that you want to access, you'll need to submit a separate application. These applications ensure you meet specific requirements for each fund.


## Application Review
Once you've submitted your applications, our team will review them carefully. We assess your eligibility based on several factors, including compliance checks, anti-money laundering (AML) screening, and accreditation status. If we need any additional information, we'll reach out to you directly.

Following approval, we'll send you an Investment Agreement that is populated with information provided in the application process for your review and execution. Once this is signed, you're ready to start investing.


## Entity Setup
Before making your first investment, you'll need to configure two important settings for your approved Investing Entity:

- Purchase Destination: This determines how you'll receive your Fund shares. You can choose to receive tokens by providing an Ethereum wallet address, or opt for book-entry shares held by XFT.
- Payout Destination: This specifies how you'll receive funds (US Dollars or USDC) when you redeem your shares. You can choose to receive USDC by providing an Ethereum wallet address, or receive US Dollars directly to your bank account by providing your banking information.
