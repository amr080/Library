# Wallet Basics

A wallet is a blockchain user account that you control. Before you can sign up to place orders, you will need a wallet. You can bring your own or use your email to create one. Just click "Sign In" to get started.

It's important to note that a wallet created with your email will be tied to your login device. You can always transfer any assets to another wallet with XFT. If you'd like to take your wallet with you, we recommend signing up with a wallet provider first, such as Coinbase or Metamask.
