<h2>XFT Short-Term US Government Treasuries (USDX)</h2>

<p>USDX is a tokenized US treasuries fund.</p>
<p>USDX works by tokenizing shares in a closed-end fund that invests in a stable money market fund (FOBXX). The dual-token system separates the stable principal (USDX) from the yield (rUSDX), reducing run risk. USDX can be used like traditional stablecoins for payments, collateral, and trading, while rUSDX provides access to accrued yields without impacting the principal investment.</p>
